GPT-4 Text Analysis Notebook
Jonathan Young
University of Hawaii at Manoa Library

Description

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that leverages the GPT-4 API to analyze chat transcript files. Each line of the provided text file, containing individual chat transcripts, is processed by the GPT-4 API to return insightful analyses. Users can customize the analysis by specifying a coding scale, such as the READ scale, and must ensure that their data meets privacy and ethical standards before analysis.
Preliminary testing shows that GPT-4 can return accurate coding on a modified READ scale with 96% accuracy.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    Jupyter Notebook
    Internet connection for API access
    OpenAI API key (GPT-4)

Usage
Setting Up Your API Key

    Obtain your GPT-4 API key from OpenAI.  GPT-3.5 can also function, but with greatly reduced accuracy.
    In the notebook, replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual API key.

Preparing Your Data

    Prepare your chat transcript file. Each line of the file should contain one chat transcript including the initial question, which may require preprocessing of LibChat data, for example.
    Ensure that all sensitive information (like email addresses or usernames) is removed or anonymized to meet privacy and ethical standards.
    The input_file.txt should be in UTF-16 encoding.

Customizing Analysis

    In the notebook, specify the coding scale you wish to use (e.g., READ scale) in the designated section.
    Additional instructions and clarifications should be included in the prompt, as well as desired output format.
    Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis.
